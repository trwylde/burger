# burger

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Bootstrap framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user can submit a custom burger creation to the Burger Menu and devour any burger by selecting it burger from the menu.  A selected burger will be devoured (moved to the "Devoured Burger" list on the left hand side). A burger can be deleted from the Devoured Burger list by clicking the trashcan icon next to it, and "trashed" burgers are then removed from the database.
